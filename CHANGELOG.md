### [Unreleased]

### Added
- Adds neighbor count method to graph.

### [0.1.54] - 2022-08-04

#### Fixed
- Don't record empty sparse features and log warning if sparse features were requested, but dense features are stored.

## [0.1.53] - 2022-08-02

### Fixed
- JSON/TSV converter didn't sort edges by types resulted in incorrect sampling.

## [0.1.52] - 2022-07-27

### Changed
- Rename and move convert.output to converter.process.converter_process. Dispatchers make argument 'process' default to converter.process.converter_process. Dispatchers move process argument after decoder_type.

- Replace converter and dispatcher's argument "decoder_type" -> "decoder" that accepts Decoder object directly instead of DecoderType enum. Replace DecoderType enum with type hint.

- Make Decoder.decode a generator that yields a node then its outgoing edges in order. The yield format for nodes/edges is (node_id/src, -1/dst, type, weight, features), with features being a list of dense features as ndarrays and sparse features as 2 tuples, coordinates and values.

### Added
- Add BinaryWriter as new entry point for NodeWriter, EdgeWriter and alias writers.

### Removed
- Meta.json files are no longer needed by the converter. Remove meta path argument from MultiWorkerConverter and Dispatchers.

### Fixed
- Fill dimensions with 0 for missing features.
