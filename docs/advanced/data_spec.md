# Preparing Graph Data

DeepGNN supports both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs. Nodes and Edges support the following attributes,
  * Node/Edge Type: `int`.
  * Node/Edge Weight: `float`.
  * Node/Edge Features: `float/uint64/string`.

## Graph Data Format

DeepGNN supports two file formats: JSON and TSV.
Users can generate a graph in either format then our pipeline will convert it into binary for training and inference.
DeepGNN also supports writing custom decoders, see [the decoders file](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepGNN/blob/main/src/python/deepgnn/graph_engine/snark/decoders.py).
Just inheret the base class Decoder, overwrite the decode function and pass the new decoder as an argument to the converter or dispatcher.

1. [JSON](#json-format): Heterogeneous or homegeneous graph.
2. [TSV](#tsv-format): Homogeneous graph only.

## JSON Format

The JSON format supports heterogeneous and homegeneous graphs.

`graph.json` layout,

```JSON
{
  "node_id": "int",
  "node_type": "int",
  "node_weight": "float",
  "uint64_feature": {"feature id": ["int", "..."], "...": "..."},
  "float_feature": {"feature id": ["float", "..."], "...": "..."},
  "binary_feature": {"feature id": "string", "...": "..."},
  "edge":[{
    "src_id": "int",
    "dst_id": "int",
    "edge_type": "int",
    "weight": "float",
    "uint64_feature": {"feature id": ["int", "..."], "...": ["int", "..."]},
    "float_feature": {"feature id": ["float", "..."], "...": ["float", "..."]},
    "binary_feature": {"feature id": "string", "...": "..."},
    "sparse_int32_feature": {"feature id": {"coordinates": [["non zero coordinates 0"], ["non zero coordinates 1", "..."]], "values": ["value 0", "value 1", "..."]}},
  }, "..."]
}
```

Here is a concrete example,

```JSON
{
  "node_id": 5797133,
  "node_type": 0,
  "node_weight": 1.0,
  "uint64_feature": {},
  "float_feature": {"0": [-490.0, 797.0, 2069.0], "1": [1967.0, 1280.0]},
  "binary_feature": {"2": "microsoft", "1": "bing"},
  "edge":[
    {
      "src_id": 5797133,
      "dst_id": 6103589,
      "edge_type": 0,
      "weight": 2.0,
      "uint64_feature": {},
      "float_feature": {"0": [-1.531, 1.34, 0.235, 2.3], "1": [-2.1, 0.4, 0.35, 0.3]},
      "binary_feature": {"2": "welcome"},
      "sparse_uint64_feature": {"3": {"coordinates": [[5, 13], [7, 25]], "values": [-1, 1024]}},
    },
    {
      "src_id": 5797133,
      "dst_id": 6892569,
      "edge_type": 0,
      "weight": 1.3,
      "uint64_feature": {},
      "float_feature": {"0": [-0.31, -2.04, 0.53, 0.123], "1": [-3.1, 0.4, 0.35, 0.3]},
      "binary_feature": {"2": "hello DeepGNN."}
    }
  ]
}
```

## TSV Format

Currently TSV format ONLY support homogenous graphs.

The format requires the file graph.tsv as follows,

```tsv
| node_id | node_type | node_weight | node_features                | neighbors                                  |
| --------|-----------|-------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1       | 0         | 0.1         | f:0.1 0.2;b:str_feat;i:1 2 3 | 2, 0, 0.3, 1, f:0.1 0.2;b:str_feat;i:1 2 3 |
...
```

node_id: int, The node's unique identifier.
node_type: int, Node type, typically 0 for training, 1 for testing and 2 for inference.
node_weight: float, Node weight.
node_features: | type1:v1 v2;type2:v1 v2 |, Node feature vectors, type can be one of the following: {f: float, b: binary, i: integer}. There can be any number of values for each feature. There can only be a single vector for each feature type.
neighbors: | int, int, float, int, features |, src_id, dst_id, edge_weight, edge_type and a feature vector in the same form as node_features.

# fsspec support

DeepGNN supports reading graph data from different data sources such as local file system, http, HDFS... This is done by using `fsspec` library. When loading data from a specific storage, user need to specify the full path of the graph data, for example, if the graph is in local file system, the path should be "/path/to/local/graph/data", if graph data is in HDFS, user need to specify `hdfs://domain/path/to/graph/data`. DeepGNN will try to parse the file protocol and download the graph data to local temporary folder, and local them into graph engine servers. More details can be found here: [_downloader.py](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepGNN/blob/main/src/python/deepgnn/graph_engine/snark/_downloader.py)

sample code:

```Python
import deepgnn.graph_engine.snark.server as server

# if the data is in local FS
data_dir = "/home/deepgnn/cora"
# if the data is in HDFS
# data_dir = "hdfs://my.hdfs.domain/data/cora"
port = 12345
s = server.Server(data_dir, [0], f"0.0.0.0:{port}")

```
